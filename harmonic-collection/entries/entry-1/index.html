afterlife we know;
the place
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
where the children we were rock
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
in the arms
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
of the children we have become. They
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
are as many as
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
leaves in their migrations; as birds whose
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
deaths we learn of &nbsp;  by
the single feather left behind: a clue, a particle
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 of sleep caught in &nbsp; the eye.They are as irretrievable as sand when the
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
sea creeps up its long life glittering in its teeth to claim its patrimony.
&nbsp;
Sometimes
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
my father in knickers and cap waits on that shore the dream of him a &nbsp;  wound not even
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
morning can heal. The dog's legs pump in his sleep; your closed &nbsp; eyelids flicker as the
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
reel unwinds: water and watched, archer and bull's eye. Dreams are the only afterlife we
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
know; the place where the children we were rock in the arms of the children we have become.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
They are as many as leaves in their migrations, as birds whose deaths we learn of by the single
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
feather left behind: a clue, particle of sleep caught in the eye. They are as irretrievable as sand
